## Technologies used
#### Navigation component : one activity contains multiple fragments instead of creating multiple activites.
#### Firebase Auth : Manging Accounts/ Loging in and Registrations.
#### Firebase Firestore : Database for the system.
#### Firebase Storage : To store products images and user profile pictures.
#### MVVM : Seperate logic code from views and save the state in case the screen configuration changes.
